# StreamSave Pro - Video Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution

### Original Problem
- "message port closed before a response was received" errors
- No videos being detected or downloaded, even on YouTube after page refresh

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed

#### 1. Message Port Errors
**Cause**: Missing error handling in Chrome API calls
**Fix**: Added comprehensive `chrome.runtime.lastError` checks across all components

#### 2. Video Detection Failures
**Cause**: Multiple issues with video detection logic
**Fixes Applied**:
- Improved YouTube video ID extraction (handles both `/watch` and `/shorts` URLs)
- Enhanced title and duration detection with multiple fallback selectors
- Better timing for page load and dynamic content
- Added support for additional streaming platforms (Vimeo, Dailymotion, Twitch)

### 4. Frontend Components (`src/components/Downloader.jsx`)
- Added error handling in message responses
- Better user feedback for scanning states
- Improved error messaging

### 5. Offscreen Script (`public/offscreen.js`)
- Input validation and response error checking
- Better error handling for YouTube processing

## Testing & Debugging

### Added Debugging Features
